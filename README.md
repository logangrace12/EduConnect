# EduConnect
A web-based platform designed to support low-income students by connecting them to essential resources such as transportation, donated supplies, internet programs, and scholarships, helping to break down barriers to education and promote academic success.



Problem Statement 

Many low-income students are unable to attend school or complete their education because they lack access to essential resources such as transportation, textbooks, internet access, and proper study tools. This disproportionately affects underprivileged communities, where 1 in 5 students report missing classes regularly due to these barriers. Existing programs, like public aid or nonprofit initiatives, are often underfunded, inaccessible, or poorly targeted, leaving many students without the support they need. As a result, these students experience higher dropout rates, diminished career prospects, and perpetuate cycles of poverty.


Project Description 

Proposed Solution: The project, EduConnect, is a web-based platform designed to connect low-income students with local resources, community donations, and educational assistance programs.


Who Will Use It:

Low-income students and their families
Schools and educators looking to support at-risk students
Local organizations and donors offering resources
How It Solves the Problem: EduConnect will simplify the process of locating and applying for resources by consolidating information into a single, user-friendly platform. Students will be able to find available transportation options, request donated textbooks, access subsidized internet programs, and connect with community mentors.



Key Features:

Resource Locator: A search tool to find nearby transportation, educational tools, and internet access programs based on the student's ZIP code.
Donation Matching: A system that pairs students in need with community members or organizations willing to donate supplies or funds.
Scholarship Finder: A feature to help students discover and apply for scholarships and grants tailored to their financial situation.
Progress Tracker: Allows students and families to track resource applications and usage.
Mobile-Friendly Design: Optimized for accessibility on smartphones to ensure ease of use.




Technologies to Use:

Frontend: React.js for an interactive user interface
Backend: Node.js and Express.js for server-side functionality
Database: MongoDB for storing user and resource information
APIs: Integration with existing tools like Google Maps for resource locations
Hosting: GitHub Pages or AWS for deployment



Estimated Scope: The scope is reasonable for one semester:

Milestone 1: Design UI/UX and set up the frontend
Milestone 2: Implement the resource locator and donation matching features
Milestone 3: Develop the backend and database integration
Milestone 4: Final testing and deployment
